# Conformal Predictive Systems

This repository contains R code to generate conformal predictive systems using:
- Least Squared Prediction Machines (LSPM)
- Conformal Isotonic Distributional Regression (IDR)
- Conformal Binning


## Installation and development

This package has not been submitted to CRAN, and can therefore be installed in R using devtools
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("sallen12/ConformalIDR")
```
The package is still in active development, and the vignette lists several possible extensions that could be implemented. Comments, suggestions, and input are more than welcome.
